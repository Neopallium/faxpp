Faxpp: A small, fast XML pull parser written in C with an API that can
return UTF-8 or UTF-16 strings.

version 0.2 (2007.08.20):
	* Implemented a test harness for the XML Conformance Test Suite
	* Added support for streaming input to the tokenizer and parser,
	  without the need for a callback function.
	* Implemented an encoding framework to allow the user to specify
	  implementation defined encodings based on a document's
	  declared encoding.
	* Added built-in decoding support for ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).
	* Implemented attribute value normalization, adding a parser
	  option to enable/disable it.
	* Recognize built in entity references - raise an error
	  for any unknown entity.
	* Implemented the XML 1.0 char classes as well as the XML 1.1
	  ones, and switched between them depending on the XML version
	  declaration.
	* Added tokens for the end of the XML declaration, and the built
	  in entity references.
	* Check for restricted characters anywhere in the document.
	* Check for illegal "]]>" in element content.
	* Require whitespace between attributes.
	* Fix handling of namespace 1.1 prefix undefines.
	* Fixed a bug in entity output in the examples.
	* Added a todo list.
